# SystemAnalysisAndDesign

The proprietor of DriverPass intends to develop a website dedicated to driver training. They believe that inadequate training is leading to a high failure rate among students. The client, the owner of DriverPass, seeks a system allowing student drivers to enroll in driving courses. The envisioned system enables users to create accounts, select driving packages, access online training, undertake examinations, and receive practical road training. The owner will have administrative access to oversee student and staff accounts. I believe I effectively addressed the design requirements for this system, which is a crucial step requiring meticulous attention. However, I recognize the need for enhancing both functional and non-functional requirements. Given the evolving nature of projects, I aim to stabilize this part by soliciting feedback from students, instructors, and employers using the platform. Incorporating user input, especially from active users, is immensely valuable for refining the system. I meticulously dissected the various requirements from distinct stakeholders—clients, students, owner, and employees—ensuring a comprehensive understanding. The client's specifications hold immense significance as they form the backbone of the project. Without precise requirements, the project lacks direction and purpose. In my software design approach, I would prioritize gathering new system functionalities' requirements. Then, I'd proceed to design and integrate these features. Subsequently, I'd actively seek feedback to comprehend areas needing improvement. Analyzing the constraints within the system would guide me in implementing necessary fixes or modifications to enhance its functionality and user experience.
